     <p class="text">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in
         a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC.
     </p>
    <p class="text"> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour.

    <p class="text"> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
        you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
